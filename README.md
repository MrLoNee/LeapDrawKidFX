LeapDrawKidFX

Draw kid program done with LeapMotion and JavaFX.

The gesture part is the following :

* One finger pointed and the position along z axis is negative -> drawing 
* One finger pointed and the position along z axis is positive -> moving cursor
* One finger pointed and the position along z axis transitioned from positive to negative value -> new drawing line
* One hand opened (at least 4 fingers) the color chooser menu is displayed
* One hand opened the hand position is used to move the cursor (and choose a color by going through one)


You will need to separately download the LeapMotion SDK at https://developer.leapmotion.com/ and use its LeapJava.jar and associated native library to launch this program.
